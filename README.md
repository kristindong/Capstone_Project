Features we plan to use for the model:

1. Gross Profit Margin = (Revenue - Cost of Sales) / Revenue * 100
2. Net Profit Margin = Net Profit / Revenue * 100
3. Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
4. Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
5. Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
6. Leverage = Total Assets / Total Equity
7. Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Equity
8. Inventory Turnover = Cost of Sales / (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory / 2)
9. Total Asset Turnover = Revenue / (Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets / 2)
10. Return on Equity (ROE) = Net Profit / (Beginning Equity + Ending Equity) / 2
11. Return on Assets (ROA) = Net Profit / (Beginning Total Assets + Ending Total Assets) / 2
12. Operating cash flow
13. Earnings per Share (EPS)
14. Price-Earnings Ratio (P/E)
