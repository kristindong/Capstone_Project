Financial Indicators vs Stock Market Performance

The allure of better understanding the relationship between a companies finanacial data and it's stockmarket performance is obvious. The market may seem chaotic, but with enough data can we gain clearer picture of which factors are significantly tied to a stocks performacne?

Our data set is composed of over 200 key financial indicators typically found in anual the 10-k fillings from roughly 4000 companies for the years 2014 - 2018. Though voluminous, the data set in neither complete (there are some nul values) nor perfect (there are some suspicious outliers) and will require some cleaning. 

With this data and our sophisticated analysis, we hope to determine if it is possible to predict the performance of a stock from key financial indicators and if so, which indicators are the most strongly tied to a companies performance.
